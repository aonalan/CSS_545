1. The intended platform for the final project is iOS, but we will be 
relying on Android emulators in order to test our project since 
my group mates and I use Windows laptops and not Macs. However,
we will at some later point run our application on a device that 
uses iOS.

2. As a group we have decided to use the REACT programming language.
This is due to REACT allowing for both iOS and Android development, 
in the case that we end up deciding to make changes to which plafrom 
we want to work with.

3. My group has expressed interest in cross platform development,
which is why we have chosen to use REACT Native/JavaScript. This is 
perticularly helpful for us becuase we would want to have a iOS 
application as we all have iOS devices, but not all of us have access
to a Mac. So, we will develop for cross platform and run our application
mainly in Android emulators as mentioned above. 

4. We want to develop for iOS because we all have Apple mobile phones.
 We decided to use REACT as our programming language because 
 we want to make our application for the iOS platform but 
 we do not all have Apple Mac laptops. We are interested in cross
 platform development because we are using windows to develop and will
 be using an Android emulator to test our application with the eventual 
 goal to run it on iOS as well.
