1. The intended platform for the final project is iOS, but we will be 
relying on Android emulators in order to test our project since 
my group mates and I use Windows laptops and not Macs. However,
we will at some later point run our application on a device that 
uses iOS.

2. As a group we have decided to use the REACT programming language.
This is due to REACT allowing for both iOS and Android development, 
in the case that we end up deciding to make changes to which plafrom 
we want to work with.

3. My group has expressed interest in cross platform development,
because we would like to use Windows for developing our iOS 
application. This will require use to test and troubleshoot our 
application as we are developing it.

4. We decided to use iOS because we all have Apple mobile phones, 
 and figured it would be best for testing out our project. 
 We decided to use REACT as our programming language because 
 we want to make our application for the iOS platform but 
 we do not all have Apple Mac laptops. We are interested in cross
 platform development because we are using windows while developing
 an iOS application.
